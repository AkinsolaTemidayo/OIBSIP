              Maya Angelou, an extraordinary woman whose words have inspired
              generations, continues to illuminate the world with her wisdom,
              resilience, and compassion.

              Her autobiography, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," remains a
              timeless masterpiece, shedding light on themes of identity,
              racism, and womanhood.

              Moreover, Maya Angelou's commitment to social justice and equality
              served as a guiding light during tumultuous times. She remains a
